Sova: An Agent
</h1>
<p style="font-size: 22px; font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif">Sova is an agent in VALORANT known for his ability to find enemies regardless of where they are. This utility can help lots<br>
in matches, ranging from finding whether a team is attacking at B or just to find someone through a Brimstone smoke. The<br>
best thing about this ability is that it can be used multiple times in a round, taking about 40 seconds to recharge. This<br>
is likely Sova's best ability, excluding his ultimate.</p>

When I switched to playing Sova, I learned that he had a lot of lineups for some maps. However, I noticed that they were all<br>
in different sites. This crappy HTML doc made by a complete noob coder attempts to fix that problem.
